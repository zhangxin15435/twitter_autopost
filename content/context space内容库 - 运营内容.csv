"Welcome to AIFlowWatch! I’ll share what I learn building with RAG, agents, and generative pipelines—plus Big Tech moves worth watching. If you care about AI workflows beyond cool demos, stick around. Let’s navigate this together. #AIcommunity",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/27,干货洞察,纯文字,,,是,,,
"AI agents are here: they plan, call APIs, and execute tasks autonomously. Projects like AutoGen & CrewAI show agents are more than hype. Real products are being built today. #AIagents",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/27,,,,,是,,,
"RAG ≠ magic. If your index is outdated, your answers will be too. Always monitor your embeddings & refresh your knowledge base. Production RAG needs ops discipline. #LLMops",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/28,,,,,是,,,
"Fine-tuning vs. RAG? Fine-tuning bakes knowledge into weights, great for fixed domains. RAG keeps info fresh & dynamic. Choose wisely: use both if you can. #AI",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/28,,,,,否,,,
"OpenAI’s rumored GPT-5, Google’s Gemini updates, and Meta’s new open-source agents—all in the last 30 days. The pace of AI innovation has never been faster. #AInews",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/29,,,,,否,,,
"Generative AI workflows need orchestration: memory, planning, and evaluation. Prompt chaining isn’t enough. Next-gen apps require proper pipelines. #AIworkflows",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/29,,,,,否,,,
"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the new frontier of LLMs: it combines knowledge retrieval with generation, keeping models up-to-date without retraining. Don’t sleep on it. #AI #RAG",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/30,,,,,否,,,
"“RAG Hallucination” is real: models can hallucinate even retrieved facts. Combat it with hybrid search, context filters, and human-in-the-loop validation. #AI #RAG",张曦月,ai flow watch,2025/06/30,,,,,否,,,
